GBM
- Type 1: 6 modules including cycling
- Type 2: 6 modules where cycling cells are transformed to their 2nd highest score
- Type 3: Same as Type 2 but reduced to 4 modules
- Type 4: NPC/OPC reduced to 'undiff', AC/MES reduced to 'diff'
- Type 5: NPC/OPC reduced to 'PRO'
- Type 6: Same as Type 1 reduced to 4 modules

IDH
- Type_max: cell state based on max module score
- Type_max2: cell state based on max module score, reduced to main cell types (AC, OC, cycling, stemness)
- Tirosh_Type_PCA:  cell state based on Tirosh method, without cycling
- Tirosh_Type_PCA2: same as above, WITH cycling
- Tirosh_Type_PCA_MICE: cell state based on Tirosh+mice method, without cycling
- Tirosh_Type_PCA_MICE2: cell state based on Tirosh+mice method, WITH cycling
